         As an English-major student in NTUST, most of my courses focus on English, which comprehends every aspect, including listening,
         speaking, reading, and writing. Besides all these practical skills which can be applied to our real social life, I also learn
         some theoretical fields, such as linguistics, phonetics, and language acquisition, all of which are helpful for my future career
         of teaching. Last but not least, I have also taken French courses at school, two hours per week, for 4 semesters.

        <p>
          In last February, I went Prague for exchange program, for 6 months. In that foreign country, it was mandatory for me to speak
          English and listen to other people’s English with different exotic accents. Therefore, during my exchange study in Prague, my
          English speaking and listening truly improved a lot.

        <h3 id="mos_burger">Mos Burger</h3>
        <p>
          Mos Burger is a fast food restaurant which originates from Japan. I work in Mos Burger as a waitress to serve the customers their
          meals and also a cashier to take orders. At work, I need to not only tackle everything from the customers with patience and smile,
          but also keep everywhere in the restaurant clean and tidy. Besides, since all my co-workers are from different kinds of fields,
          definitely we have very not-similar personality. Thus, it’s mandatory for me to learn how to get along with them in harmony.

        <h3 id="cram_school">Cram School</h3>
        <p>
          Tact is a cram school which offers individual (one-to-one) education to students from primary school to high school, from age 7
          to age 18. The students I teach are from all the levels. Since they have pretty different characteristics, learning habits, and
          English aptitude, I need to adjust my teaching materials and methods according to what I mentioned above. Furthermore, besides
          the needs of the students, the opinions of the parents should be taken care of as well. Through this, I learn how to interact
          and communicate with the parents in a good way.
