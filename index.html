        <p>
         As an English-major student in NTUST, most of my courses focus on English, which comprehends every aspect, including listening,
         speaking, reading, and writing. Besides all these practical skills which can be applied to our real social life, I also learn
         some theoretical fields, such as linguistics, phonetics, and language acquisition, all of which are helpful for my future career
         of teaching. Last but not least, I have also taken French courses at school, two hours per week, for 4 semesters.

        <p>
          In last February, I went Prague for exchange program, for 6 months. In that foreign country, it was mandatory for me to speak
          English and listen to other people’s English with different exotic accents. Therefore, during my exchange study in Prague, my
          English speaking and listening truly improved a lot.

        <h3 id="mos_burger">Mos Burger</h3>
        <p>
          Mos Burger is a fast food restaurant which originates from Japan. I work in Mos Burger as a waitress to serve the customers their
          meals and also a cashier to take orders. At work, I need to not only tackle everything from the customers with patience and smile,
          but also keep everywhere in the restaurant clean and tidy. Besides, since all my co-workers are from different kinds of fields,
          definitely we have very not-similar personality. Thus, it’s mandatory for me to learn how to get along with them in harmony.

        <h3 id="cram_school">Cram School</h3>
        <p>
          Tact is a cram school which offers individual (one-to-one) education to students from primary school to high school, from age 7
          to age 18. The students I teach are from all the levels. Since they have pretty different characteristics, learning habits, and
          English aptitude, I need to adjust my teaching materials and methods according to what I mentioned above. Furthermore, besides
          the needs of the students, the opinions of the parents should be taken care of as well. Through this, I learn how to interact
          and communicate with the parents in a good way.

        <h3 id="vidaorange">TechOrange, VidaOrange</h3>
        <p>
            Techorange and its branch platform, Vidaorange, are both online media which provide the masses with articles about technology,
            and politics and economics, respectively. My work is mainly to edit the articles collected from other websites or written by
            the authors in our company, translate some articles from English to Chinese, and also write my own articles.

        <h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

        <h3>Volunteer in Children’s Home</h3>
        <p>
          In this five-day summer camp, the children we needed to take care of were physically challenged. First of all, the volunteers needed to
          get familiar with all the activities and games. Thus, since these children were more sensitive and emotionally unstable, we had to know
          individual psycho-physical condition and the appropriate ways to deal with the problems they may have. During this time I might confront
          some unexpected situations and somehow negative feelings occurred to me, but these would just disappear whenever I heard they called my
          name and saw their angelic smile.

        <h3>English Reader at Elementary School</h3>
        <p>
          In this event, we were assigned to a specific class and guided the students to read English stories in class. Based on the difference
          in English level among classes, we had to choose suitable stories for the students, and interpret the content of the stories with our
          own creativity. In addition to the course design, the teaching strategies we adopted and the activities
          we arranged needed to be more interaction-oriented and entertaining as well.

        <h3 id="vice_president">Vice President of Student Association</h3>
        <p>
          In the second year of my college life, I was selected as the vice president of the Student Association of Applied Foreign
          Languages (my department).
          What I was in charge of is to organize some activities for our department or with other departments at school, contact the
          related companies which cooperated with our department, and build the harmonious happy atmosphere among students in this
          department.
        </p>

        <h3 id="receptionist">Receptionist in Conferences</h3>
        <p>
          Two conferences were held at my school. Taiwan and Thailand Higher Education Forum & International Conference on Applied Linguistics and Language Teaching.
          Since most of the guests are from foreign countries, it was necessary for the school to look for some people who speak fluent English to help them receive
          the guests. Thus, I volunteered. Before the conferences, we had a training course which taught us how to behave well, such as standing, walking, talking,
          and so on. During the period of the conferences, what I needed to do is to take the guests to their seats and served them their needs.
